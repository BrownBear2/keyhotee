== Communicating between Keyhotee clients ==

=== General notes ===
* If you build a release version of Keyhotee, the executable will be called "keyhotee". The debug version is called "keyhoteed".
* The Keyhotee executable is built to ${INVICTUS_ROOT}/bin


== Profiles in Keyhotee ==
* A profile is used by Keyhotee to store your identities, contacts, messages, etc. If multiple users plan to use Keyhotee on the same machine, each should generally create his own profile. 
* If no command-line argument is used to launch Keyhotee, a profile named "default" will be used. Otherwise, the argument will specify the name of the profile.
* If the profile doesn't yet exist when Keyhotee is launched, a new profile will be created. In this case Keyhotee will launch a wizard to create your brain wallet and your first identity.
* For my profiles, I use: "default", "second", "third", etc.
* For my identities, I use "first", "second", "third", etc.
* I recommend using the same password for all your profiles, this makes it easier to remember.

=== Steps to setup communication between clients ===
* Run "keyhotee" (or keyhoteed if you built a debug version) and create a new identity (this first profile is "default" profile). I typically call this identity "first".
* Run a second copy of keyhotee by typing "keyhotee second" and create a new identity. I typically call this identity "second".
* Shut down keyhotee (don't bother mining the second identity yet).
* On windows, launch an explorer window and go to "C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Invictus Innovations, Inc\Keyhotee\". You can get close to this directory by going to %appdata%. This directory stores your profile directories. You should see a default profile and a second profile directory. Go into the second directory and edit the config.json file. Change it to look like this:
{
  "data_dir": "C:/Users/Administrator/AppData/Local/Invictus Innovations, Inc/Keyhotee/second/data",
  "network_port": 10876,
  "rpc_config": {
    "port": 10877,
    "user": "",
    "pass": ""
  },
  "enable_upnp": false,
  "default_nodes": [
    "127.0.0.1:9876"
  ]
}
This tells the second client to hook up to the default client.

=== Configuring the two clients to "know each other" so that they mine on same block chain ===
* Run "keyhoteed" again to launch the default profile client (this client must be started first).
* Run "keyhoteed second" to launch the second profile client.
* In both clients,  enable mining from the Identity/Enable Mining long enough to successfully mine each identity.
* In the default client, create a new contact for "second" (if it says this Keyhotee ID is not registered, it means it wasn't mined enough or else the two clients didn't connect up properly).
* In the "second" client, create a new contact for "first" (if it says this Keyhotee ID is not registered, it means it wasn't mined enough or else the two clients didn't connect up properly).
* You should now be able to send chats and emails back and forth between the two clients.
